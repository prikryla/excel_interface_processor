This small project was created in response to a task that needs to be processed every day and is very easy to automate. 
This saves users of this tool a few minutes of time.

UPLOAD BOTH FILES YOU WANT TO USE TO THIS FOLDER
All you have to do is select the file you were last editing first. 
For the second file, select the one you just downloaded and need to edit.

After processing today's file, this file will be saved under the same name, but it will already be updated. 
The file will be saved in the same folder in which you run the .exe file
